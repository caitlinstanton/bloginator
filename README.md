<h2>What is it:</h2>

<p>
 Bloginator is a web app run on Flask and with its information
 stored in a SQL database. Before logging in, visitors can see
 all blog posts ever created by every user. After logging in, users
 are able to create new posts or edit old ones. This updates the 
 information in the SQL database.
